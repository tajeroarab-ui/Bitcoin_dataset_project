### Project Overview: Bitcoin Price Forecasting Using Regression Models

This project applies statistical and machine learning regression models to analyze and forecast Bitcoin prices based on historical trading data. The goal is to understand how key market indicators — such as open, high, low, and volume — influence Bitcoin’s closing price and to build a predictive framework that can estimate future price movements.

Bitcoin’s market is characterized by high volatility, non-linearity, and sensitivity to trading volume and investor sentiment. To address this, the project uses a Linear Regression model as a baseline forecasting tool to evaluate trend predictability and model interpretability. The results highlight the potential of data-driven methods in understanding and predicting cryptocurrency dynamics, providing valuable insights for traders, researchers, and financial analysts.
The analysis involves:

* Cleaning and transforming raw historical Bitcoin data.

* Engineering lag-based features to capture short-term dependencies.

* Fitting a regression model to predict future closing prices.

* Evaluating model accuracy using MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics.

* Visualizing actual vs predicted Bitcoin price trends.
